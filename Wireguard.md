# Introduction 
For this Wireguard Project, we are creating a Digital Ocean account and do the following:
- Create a DO Ubuntu droplet 
- Install Docker on the droplet 
- Install Wireguard 
- Test the VPN on our phone and laptop

# Creating the account and droplet 
1. For the first step, we need first create an account on DigitalOcean, since Codi provided a link on the powerpoint slides, click it. This will give us $200 credit for 2 month of usage: `https://m.do.co/c/4d7f4ff9cfe4` . Sign up by inputting your email and password. 
2. For this step, we need to create an Ubuntu 20.04 Droplet, first by creating a new project and have these as the following: `Ubuntu 20.04, Basic, and Regular Intel CPU`. We want the cheapest droplet so do $4/month. For the datacenter, you can send it to whatever you want (I chose New York). 
3. After having those setting, there will be a section if you want to choose either SSH Key or Password. While password is much easier to do, it is less secure than SSH Key. For this installation process, I decided to go with SSH.
