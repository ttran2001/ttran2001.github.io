# Docker Compose Lab (Project 2) 

## Introduction 
For this project, the objective is to install Docker Enviroment and have the choice into three main choices of either:
- Installing OpenVAS via Docker
- Installing WordPress via Docker 
- Installing PiHole via Docker
For my choice, I decided on installing Docker Enviroment via Windows and went with the option of installing WordPress via Docker. These are the steps I took into installing both Docker and WordPress via Docker.
